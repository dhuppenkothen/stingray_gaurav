This is a JAX implementation of the GP tool by `Hubener et al <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.12716.pdf#:~:text=ABSTRACT%20Analyses%20of%20quasi%2Dperiodic,flares%20and%20fast%20radio%20bursts.>`_ 
for QPO detection and parameter analysis.

This feature makes use of tinygp library for Gaussian Processes implementation, and jaxns for nested sampling,
and is kept in the stingray.modeling.gpmodelling module.

Main features of the module are:

- get_prior: This function makes the prior function for a specified prior dictionary.
- get_likelihood: This function makes the log_likelihood function for the given Kernel, Mean model and lightcurve.
- GPResult class: The class which takes a Lightcurve, and performs Nested Sampling for a given prior and likelihood.
